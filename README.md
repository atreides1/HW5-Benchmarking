# Steps for Performance Evaluation

### 1. State the goals and define the system boundaries.


### 2. List services and outcomes.


### 3. Select metrics: criteria to compare performance.
  


### 4. List parameters: system and workload.


### 5. Select factors: for those parameters that will be varied.


### 6. Select evaluation technique: measurement, simulation, and/or analysis.


### 7. Select workload: a list of service requests to the system.


### 8. Design experiments to maximize information and minimize effort.


### 9. Analyze and interpret data.


### 10. Present results
